This project is working, but it is unfinished.

This script allows you to create node "toy" apps, where you create and run your app 
with client, server, and template code embedded in one file. You can expand across files if you want,
but the main purpose is to have your core web app code condensed for the sake of simplicity.

Look at the examples/ folder to see how it can be used.

I have plans to make this very flexible, such as having it work with different languages, stacks, base configurations.

Scripts support a shebang line, so you'll be able to simply execute the file and have all the necessary
temporary files generated when you run it.

This repo is not a package yet, but will be in the future.
